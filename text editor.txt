Abstract:

The Text editor application operates by manipulating plain text files. A plain text file is shown and edited using the basic features of the editor.
We have developed this text editor using Eclipse IDE. In this application, we edit text files. So, Text editor comprises of Java Swings and AWT. 
This project has all the frames prepared in swing. Swing offers stronger and manageable GUI components compares to AWT. Modern java GUI is represented by swing.
Swing was a result of the shortcomings in java’s original GUI sub system: The Abstract Window Toolkit. AWT is a fundamental set of controls, windows, 
and dialog boxes that add a usable but restricted graphical interface. 

Software Requirements:
• Eclipse IDE
• Windows 7 or above
• JAVA platform SE 8 or above
